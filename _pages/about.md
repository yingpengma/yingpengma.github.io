<h1 style="font-family: 'Trajan', serif; font-size: 22px; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none;">The limits of language mean the limits of world.</h1>

Hello, I'm **Yingpeng Ma** (马英鹏). I'm currently an M.S. student in Computer Science at the [NLP2CT Lab](http://nlp2ct.cis.umac.mo/) <img src='./images/nlp2ct.png' style='width: 2em;'>, University of Macau, advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the Westlake NLP Lab <img src='./images/westlake_logo.png' style='width: 4em;'>, supervised by [Prof. Yue Zhang (张岳)](https://frcchang.github.io/) and [Dr. Linyi Yang (杨林易)](https://yanglinyi.github.io/). I earned my B.E. degree from **Northwestern Polytechnical University** (NWPU, 西北工业大学)  <img src='./images/nwpu_logo.png' style='width: 6em;'>, supervised by [Prof. Chunwei Tian (田春伟)](https://hellloxiaotian.github.io/).

My research interests lie in **Natural Language Processing** and **Large Language Models**, with a particular focus on **Story Generation**. For me, language is more than a tool for communication; it defines the boundaries of our perception and thought, as Wittgenstein stated: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." My fascination with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from this very idea. I am driven to explore if machines can also possess and expand such boundaries. Through my research, especially in story generation, I work towards enabling models to build internal worlds, understand complex causality, and ultimately generate meaningful narratives. I see this not only as a technical challenge, but as a deep exploration into the nature of intelligence and creativity itself.
